Tools I made for Fortnite.

## Note this before install

An Nvidia card compatible with cuda 11.7 is recommended.__
If you don't have this, the program will be slow.

### Prerequisites

Install python 3.10 https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.10/python-3.10.10-amd64.exe__
Install cuda if you have an Nvidia card that supports it https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive

### Installing

Install the requirements by executing install_requirements.bat

Execute install_gpu.bat if you downloaded cuda and installed it on your supported Nvidia card, else execute install_cpu.bat
